# RNA-language-models
Predict SARS-CoV-2 genome interactions based on RNA language models
We employed traditional classifier methods, the transfer learning-based deepRAM model, and the downstream task transfer RNAErnie large language model. The data used have already been uploaded. The original deepRAM model code is available at https://github.com/MedChaabane/deepRAM. The original RNAErnie model code can be found at https://github.com/CatIIIIIIII/RNAErnie.
